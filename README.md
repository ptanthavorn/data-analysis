   **Tools used:** Python, Google Cloud, BigQuery, Looker  
   **Objective:** Designed and implemented a data pipeline (ETL) that scrapes grocery pricing data from Target.com, stores the raw data in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket, and loads it    into a BigQuery table to serve as a data source for Looker dashboards.
